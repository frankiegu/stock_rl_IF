#deep Q learning and policy gradient appilcation in future domain

1.use gym and keras to implement the DQN and PG method.\n
2.the market_dqn.py is the implementation of DQN.\n
3.the market_pg.py is the implementatio of PG\n
4.market_env.py is the implementation of the market env. it inherit the gym.env to simulate a market enviroment.\n
5.the result file is in dqn_result and pg_result. \n
6.we get a good result and less time cost when we use pg algo. \n
