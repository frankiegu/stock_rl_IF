#deep Q learning and policy gradient appilcation in future domain
>
1.use gym and keras to implement the deep Q learning  and deep policy gradient  method.
>
2.the market_dqn.py is the implementation of DQN.
>
3.the market_pg.py is the implementatio of PG.
>
4.market_env.py is the implementation of the market env. it inherits the gym.env to simulate a market enviroment.
>
5.the result file is in dqn_result and pg_result. the number in each png means iteration times.
>
6.we get a good result and less time cost when we use PG algo.you can refer to the pg_result to see the final result.
I am sorry that I can not offer you the data because of some reasons.
